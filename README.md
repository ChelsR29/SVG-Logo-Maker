# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

This is a command-line application that accepts user input to generate a logo and save it as an svg file. This project was built to furhter my understanding of object-oriented programming. More specficially, I gained knowledge on how to use jest to run unit tests and inquier to collect user input. I also learned how to place common functionality and properties shared by child classes in a parent class and use inheritance to reuse the code in the child classes.
